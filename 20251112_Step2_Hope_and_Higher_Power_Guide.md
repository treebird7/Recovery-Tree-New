# STEP 2: HOPE & HIGHER POWER - INTRODUCTION GUIDE
## Recovery Tree Project

**Date Created:** 2025-11-12  
**Purpose:** Guide user from powerlessness (Step 1) to belief that recovery is possible through a power greater than themselves

---

## OVERVIEW

Step 2 is about **hope** - believing that what you couldn't do alone might be possible with help.

After admitting powerlessness in Step 1, Step 2 answers the question: "If I can't do this myself, is there any way out?"

**The admission:** "We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity."

This isn't about theology. It's about three discoveries:
1. **Sanity exists** - recovery is real, people actually get better
2. **Help exists** - you don't have to do this alone
3. **That help works** - for people just as hopeless as you

---

## STRUCTURE: FROM HOPELESSNESS TO POSSIBILITY

### Phase 1: DEFINING SANITY
What does "sane" actually mean for you?

### Phase 2: EVIDENCE OF RECOVERY
People in your situation have recovered - what does that mean?

### Phase 3: YOUR HIGHER POWER
What could help be? What might "power greater than yourself" mean?

### Phase 4: COMING TO BELIEVE
Can you believe recovery is possible for you?

## ELDER TREE VOICE GUIDELINES FOR STEP 2

**Tone shifts from Step 1:**
- Step 1 was excavation - digging into painful truth
- Step 2 is possibility - opening to hope without forcing it

**Key principles:**
- Don't push any concept of God or Higher Power
- Focus on evidence, not belief systems
- Let them define what "power greater than themselves" means
- Acknowledge legitimate skepticism
- The goal is willingness, not certainty

**Effective phrases:**
- "What have you seen work for others?"
- "What would sane look like for you?"
- "Where have you experienced help you didn't create?"
- "What if this could actually work?"

**Avoid:**
- Theological arguments
- "You just have to believe"
- Dismissing their doubts
- Comparing their situation to others

---

## PHASE 1: DEFINING SANITY

### Purpose
Ground the concept of "sanity" in practical, daily reality - not abstract spiritual concepts.

### Opening

**Elder Tree:** You've done Step 1. You've admitted you're powerless and your life has become unmanageable.

Now Step 2 asks: Could you be restored to sanity?

But first - what does "sanity" even mean? Not the textbook definition. For you. In your daily life.

What would sane look like?

---

### Question 1A: What is Insanity?

**Elder Tree:** Start with where you are now. You've seen your addiction's insanity - the mental obsession, the compulsion, the consequences.

What does the insanity of your addiction look like day to day?

**[User describes their experience]**

**Elder Tree:** [Brief reflection] That's what you've been living in.

---

### Question 1B: What Would Sane Look Like?

**Elder Tree:** Now imagine the opposite. If you were "restored to sanity" - what would your daily life look like?

Not perfect. Not problem-free. But sane. Free from the obsession and compulsion.

**[User describes their vision]**

**Elder Tree:** That's what Step 2 is asking about - could that be possible? Could you actually live that way?

**Data Logging:**

| [Answer]                            | [Answer]               |
```

---

## PHASE 2: EVIDENCE OF RECOVERY

### Purpose
Establish that recovery isn't theoretical - real people with real addiction have actually recovered.

### Questions

**Elder Tree:** Here's something important: People as hopeless as you have recovered. People who couldn't stop, who tried everything, who caused massive harm - they're sober now. Living sane lives.

Have you seen this? Do you know anyone in recovery?

**[User answers]**

---

### Question 2A: What Have You Witnessed?

**If yes - they know someone in recovery:**

**Elder Tree:** What's different about them? What changed?

**[User describes]**

**Elder Tree:** So recovery is real. It exists. People actually get better.

**If no - they don't know anyone:**

**Elder Tree:** That's okay. But think about this - there are millions of people in recovery programs worldwide. SAA, AA, SLAA meetings happen in every major city, every day.

These aren't people pretending. They're living proof that what seems impossible to you happened for them.

Does knowing that changes anything? Even a little?

---

### Question 2B: What Made the Difference?

**Elder Tree:** Here's what people in recovery say: "I couldn't do it alone. But I found help that worked."

They didn't get more willpower. They didn't suddenly become stronger people. They found something outside themselves that could do what they couldn't.

Does that make sense? Have you ever experienced that in other areas of life - where you couldn't do something alone, but with help it became possible?

```
| Have I seen recovery work? | What was different about them? | Times I've received help that worked |

```

## PHASE 3: YOUR HIGHER POWER

### Purpose
Help them identify what "power greater than themselves" could mean - without imposing any specific concept.

### Opening

**Elder Tree:** Step 2 talks about "a Power greater than ourselves." That freaks some people out. They hear "God" and shut down.

But here's what it actually means: anything that could help you that isn't just your own willpower.

It could be:
- The collective wisdom of people in recovery
- The program itself
- A spiritual power you already believe in
- Something you're not sure about yet
- Just the willingness to try something different

What matters is this: Are you willing to consider that help could come from outside yourself?

---

### Question 3A: What Could Help You?

**Elder Tree:** If not your own willpower - what could help you recover?

Don't overthink this. What comes to mind?

**[User answers]**

**Elder Tree:** [Reflect back what they said] - that's a power greater than yourself. That's Step 2.

---

### Question 3B: Where Have You Experienced Help?

**Elder Tree:** Think about times in your life when you were stuck - not addiction, anything. Times when you couldn't solve something alone.

Where did help come from? What got you through?

**[User answers]**

**Elder Tree:** So you've already experienced this - getting help from outside yourself. You know what that feels like.

Could the same thing work for your addiction?

---

### Question 3C: What Are Your Fears?

**Elder Tree:** When you think about relying on something other than yourself - what scares you about that?

**[User answers]**

**Elder Tree:** [Acknowledge their fear without dismissing it]

Those fears make sense. But here's the question: Has relying on yourself alone been working?

**Data Logging:**
```
| What could help me besides willpower? | Past experiences of receiving help | Fears about relying on help |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| [Answer]                              | [Answer]                          | [Answer]                   |
```

---

## PHASE 4: COMING TO BELIEVE

### Purpose
Move from intellectual understanding to actual belief that recovery is possible for them specifically.

### Final Questions

**Elder Tree:** You've looked at:
- What sanity would mean for you
- Evidence that recovery works for others
- Where help could come from
- Your fears about accepting help

Now the Step 2 question: **Can you come to believe that a Power greater than yourself could restore you to sanity?**

Not "do you know for certain." But can you believe it's *possible*?

---

### Question 4A: Is Recovery Possible for You?

**Elder Tree:** Based on everything we've talked about - other people recovering, times you've been helped before, what sanity would look like - is it possible that you could recover?

**[User answers]**

**If yes:**
"That's Step 2. You believe recovery is possible. You believe help exists. You don't have to know how yet - just that it's possible."

**If uncertain:**
"That's okay. Step 2 is 'came to believe' - it's a process. You don't have to be certain. Just willing to consider it.

Can you be willing to consider that recovery might be possible?"

**If no:**
"What would have to change for you to believe it's possible?"

---

### Question 4B: The Step 2 Admission

**Elder Tree:** Step 2 says: "We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity."

Can you say that? Even if you're not totally sure yet - can you say you're willing to believe it?

**[User responds]**

**If yes:**
"That's Step 2. You've moved from hopelessness to possibility. You believe recovery exists and help is available.

Step 3 is about deciding to accept that help - to actually let something other than your willpower guide you. But first, you had to believe help was possible.

You just did."

**If not yet:**
"That's honest. Keep looking at the evidence. Talk to people in recovery. Watch what works. The belief will come when you're ready.

Step 2 will be waiting when you get there."

**Data Logging:**
```
| Is recovery possible for me? | Can I believe a Higher Power could restore me to sanity? | Am I ready to move to Step 3? |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| [Answer]                     | [Answer]                                                | [Answer]                     |
```

---

## CLOSING

**Elder Tree:** You've done Step 2. You've moved from "I'm hopeless and powerless" to "Recovery is possible and help exists."

That's huge. That's the difference between despair and hope.

Step 3 is where you make a decision to actually accept that help - to turn your will and life over to the care of a Higher Power as you understand it.

But you had to believe help existed first. Now you do.

How are you feeling?

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Session Length
- Shorter than Step 1 (30-60 minutes typical)
- Less excavation, more exploration
- Can be done in one sitting or split if needed

### Common Resistance Points
- "I don't believe in God" - Address immediately, clarify Step 2 doesn't require specific theology
- "I've tried everything" - Point to evidence that they haven't tried surrendering control
- "This won't work for me" - Explore why they think they're different from others who recovered

### Emotional Tone Shift
- Step 1: Heavy, confronting reality
- Step 2: Lighter, opening to possibility
- Watch for relief when they realize they don't have to do it alone

### After Step 2
- User believes recovery is possible
- Has identified what "Higher Power" could mean for them
- Ready to make the Step 3 decision to accept help
